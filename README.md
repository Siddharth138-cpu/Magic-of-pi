# Magic of Pi  
*Explore the wonder of the mathematical constant œÄ (Pi) through code, visualizations and interactive experiments.*

## üöÄ Project Overview  
This repository is dedicated to uncovering the ‚Äúmagic‚Äù of Pi: its origins, the many ways it appears in mathematics and nature, how we compute and approximate it, and how you can interact with it programmatically.  
Expect:  
- Code notebooks and scripts to compute digits of Pi  
- Visualizations of Pi in geometry, statistics, waves and more  
- Interactive experiments demonstrating surprising appearances of Pi  
- A friendly, educational journey into a fundamental mathematical constant

## Why Pi matters  
- Pi is defined as the ratio of a circle‚Äôs circumference to its diameter ‚Äî yet its decimal expansion goes on forever without repeating.  
- It appears in geometry, trigonometry, waves, oscillations, statistics and even in nature‚Äôs patterns.  
- It symbolizes the deep connection between simple geometric concepts and the infinite complexity underlying them.
